# Supply Chain Delay Prediction — Findings (Day 1)

## 1. Problem Statement
Logistics companies face significant challenges in ensuring on-time deliveries. Delays can be caused by traffic congestion, weather conditions, operational inefficiencies, or high demand periods.  
This project aims to **predict whether a shipment will be delayed** based on real-time operational, environmental, and demand-related features.

By predicting delays before they occur, supply chain managers can take proactive actions — such as route adjustments, inventory allocation, or resource prioritization — to improve delivery performance and customer satisfaction.

---

## 2. Business Goal
- **Primary Goal:** Develop a machine learning model that predicts shipment delays with high accuracy, prioritizing **minimizing missed delays (high Recall)**.
- **Impact:** Reduce customer dissatisfaction, optimize logistics operations, and improve supply chain efficiency.
- **End Deliverable:** A deployed tool (Streamlit app) that allows managers to input shipment details and get an immediate delay risk prediction.

## 3. Dataset Overview
- **Source:** Smart Logistics Supply Chain Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Target Variable:** `Logistics_Delay` (1 = Delayed, 0 = On-Time)
- **Key Features:**  
  - Shipment details: `Shipment_Status`, `Waiting_Time`, `Logistics_Delay_Reason`
  - Operational metrics: `Asset_Utilization`, `Inventory_Level`
  - Environmental conditions: `Temperature`, `Humidity`
  - Demand forecasts: `Demand_Forecast`
  - Real-time tracking: `Timestamp`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`

---

## 4. Success Metrics
We prioritize:
- **Recall ≥ 80%** → catch as many delayed shipments as possible.
- **Precision ≥ 50%** → keep false alarms at a reasonable level.
- **ROC-AUC** → monitor overall classification performance.
- **Business Acceptability:** Model predictions should be interpretable for operational decisions.

---

## 5. Assumptions
- All timestamps are in the same timezone and format.
- `Logistics_Delay` is correctly labeled and represents true delays.
- Delay reasons (`Logistics_Delay_Reason`) are accurate but may contain “None” when unknown.
- Dataset represents a typical operational environment.

---

## 6. Risks & Limitations
- Missing or incorrect `Logistics_Delay_Reason` entries may reduce explainability.
- Potentially simulated or synthetic dataset — real-world noise may differ.
- Seasonal or regional variations in traffic/weather may not be captured fully.
- GPS coordinates may be incomplete or generalized.

---

## 7. Next Steps
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and correlations.
- Handle missing values and encode categorical features.
- Engineer features for better prediction (e.g., combine traffic + waiting time).
- Train baseline model and evaluate using defined success metrics.
